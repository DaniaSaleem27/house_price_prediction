House Price Prediction - Boston Housing Dataset

Description
This project predicts house prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset**.  
A simple regression model is trained and evaluated to understand how well it can predict housing prices.

Steps Performed
1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Normalized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.  
   - Filled missing values with the column mean.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Used **Linear Regression** model.  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  

Outcome
- The script outputs the RMSE of the model.
